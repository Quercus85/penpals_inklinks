    Welcome to everyone, Schmoe's discord lovers !
  </div>
  <br />
  <div class="row">
    <p>
      I am delighted to present everyone to this initiative! Thanks Schmoe for
      the endorsment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea happened by chance, when Youki offered to send a colored
      postcard and I was lucky enough to be the first to request it. Receiving
      the postcard in person gave me the idea: why don't partake in a similar
      initiative open to everyone on Schmoe's discord ?
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are a mix of an art share and secret santa: those who are
      interested will enter their discord name in the form and after a set date
      they'll be paired randomly with another pal. Then, they will send physical
      art each other !
    </p>
    <p>
      It doesn't need to be overly complicated, colored, or whatever: just put
      your soul on paper for another person and let the magic sparkle. ðŸ’–
      There's no limit about what you want to send: wherever being a watercolor
      postcard or a print, send something you feel proud or you feel it will be
      appreciated.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3 class="font-100 header text-center custom-header">Here's the rules:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        this initiative is given <span style="font-weight: bold">as is:</span> after your name has been paired, you're
        not legally bound to send something or receive it. While it goes against
        the spirit behind this initiative, things happens in life and people
        could not fulfill their part... In that case, we accept the risk. No
        hard feelings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep it small ! To avoid to spend too much in international shipping, send a postcard, 
        or an A5 sized sheet maximum (14.85 x 21cm, 5.8 x 8.3 inches)
      </li>
      <li>
        if there is an odd number of partecipants, the ones left out can ask if
        there is someone willing to make a drawing for him too. Just know i'm
        willing, so there will be always someone you can bet ðŸ˜‚
      </li>
      <li>
        You can send watercolor postcards, printings, original drawings, everything you
        feels right, made in any medium. It just have to be drawed/painted by
        you. <span style="font-weight: bold">NO AI.</span> Seriously.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take your time! After you receive your receiver's address, you don't
        have a time limit to send your drawing. Maybe don't let him wait 10 yers
        though ðŸ˜‚
      </li>
      <li>
        if you don't feel comfortable sharing your address, you can choose to be
        a giver. In that case, you will not receive anything, if not the joy to
        gift something! If there are multiple givers, they will be paired
        between them first
      </li>
      <li>
        You can ask your sender to draw a specific subject or let him decide,
        previous agreement. Don't ask for something too difficult or time
        consuming: thanks for the understanding!
      </li>
      <li>
        it would be nice to get a scan of your drawing before sending , so if
        the package gets lost, you can at least send a picture <span>&#128517</span>
